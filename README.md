# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

**SortingAlgorithmVisualizer** is a C# WinForms application designed to visualize and compare various sorting algorithms. The application provides an interactive interface to observe how different sorting algorithms operate on datasets of varying sizes. It supports the visualization of **Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Quick Sort**, **Heap Sort**, **Radix Sort**, and **Shell Sort** on datasets of **10, 25, 50, and 100 elements**.

## Features

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Visualize and compare the performance of **7 popular sorting algorithms**.
- **Dynamic Dataset Sizes**: Choose from datasets of **10, 25, 50, or 100 elements** to observe how algorithms scale.
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Watch the sorting process in real-time with animated bar charts.
- **Intuitive Interface**: A user-friendly WinForms interface makes it easy to select algorithms, dataset sizes, and start the visualization.
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for understanding how sorting algorithms work and their efficiency.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher**
- **Visual Studio 2019 or higher** (with WinForms support)

---

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Open the project in Visual Studio**
3. **Build and run**

## Usage

1. **Launch the application**.
2. **Select a sorting algorithm** from the dropdown menu (e.g., Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).
3. **Choose a dataset size** (10, 25, 50, or 100 elements).
4. **Click "Start Visualization"** to begin the sorting process.
5. **Observe the real-time visualization** of the sorting algorithm in action.

---

## Example Usage

1. Open the application.
2. Select **Quick Sort** from the algorithm dropdown.
3. Choose **50 elements** as the dataset size.
4. Click **Start Visualization**.
5. Watch as the bars representing the dataset are sorted in real-time.

## Supported Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
3. **Insertion Sort**: Builds the final sorted array one element at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.
4. **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions the dataset and recursively sorts the sub-arrays.
5. **Heap Sort**: Uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements by repeatedly extracting the maximum element.
6. **Radix Sort**: A non-comparative sorting algorithm that sorts numbers by processing individual digits.
7. **Shell Sort**: An extension of Insertion Sort that allows the exchange of elements that are far apart.
